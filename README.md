# legible

**Legible** is a programming language designed for legibility and ease of use. Its syntax resembles Markdown, providing two main benefits:

1. You can write Legible code in any Markdown editor, taking advantage of the editor's formatting and editing capabilities. This makes the code highly readable and editable.
2. Markdown's simple formatting rules mean the editor displays Legible code cleanly and clearly structured. The code is neatly formatted and organized without extra effort.

In summary, Legible leverages Markdown's lightweight formatting to create a readable, writable programming language optimized for legibility. The Markdown-like syntax ensures your Legible code stays neat and easy to follow.
